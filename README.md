# Dune-Habitats
Vegetation Communities 
Population classification is an important practice in ecological analysis of vegetation to determine if
plant species are forming hierarchal habitats. The primary focus of the paper was to investigate if distinct
sand dune and salt marsh communities were present. The study will rely upon ordination and two-way
dendrogram cluster analysis to determine if an underlying pattern is present.
